## Getting Started

### New contributor guide
To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md).

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/bucketrobotics/palmerroboticsclub.github.io/issues/new/choose). 

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/bucketrobotics/palmerroboticsclub.github.io/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. See labels for more information. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to other people. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes locally

1. Fork the repository.
- Using GitHub Desktop:
  - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
  - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

- Using the command line:
  - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

2. Install or update to **Node.js**, at the version 18.x.

3. Run npm install

4. Run npm start to start the development server

5. Create a working branch and start with your changes!
- Name it properly
- People should be able to tell what it does a first glance
- Failure to do so may lead to deletion without warning

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them.

The format for messages is follows: "{COMPONENT_NAME}: {WHAT YOU DID HERE}"

Examples of components:
- index

If not page, name it with what it does, example "routing"

### Pull Request

- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
